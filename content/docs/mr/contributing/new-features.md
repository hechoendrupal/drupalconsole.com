# Contributing new features
If you create a new custom command or something else which would be useful for *other* Drupal installations, please consider [forking the Drupal Console project on GitHub](getting-the-project.md "Fork the Drupal Console project and clone it locally to add your functionality"). Then just [create an issue for a "feature request"](creating-issues-and-pull-requests.md "Add a new feature request as an “issue” and indicate you are working on it"), put your work in a new Git branch on your fork, publish your branch and add a pull request on GitHub (including your issue ID in the PR title). The Drupal Console maintainers are very happy to accept useful contributions and usually do so quite promptly.

## Getting support with becoming a contributor
If you want to contribute to Drupal Console and have any difficulty getting oriented to the process, you can find [Instant Messaging support on Gitter IM](https://gitter.im/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole).

## Standard GitHub Workflow
If you haven't yet contributed to a project on GitHub, or are not sure you remember the workflow, you might first want to read the documentation  about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). You may also wish to download the GitHub application ([Mac](https://mac.github.com) | [Windows](https://windows.github.com), which simplifies the workflow a bit and provides a nice GUI for your contributions).

## Github-flavored Markdown
This documentation is written in “Github-flavored Markdown”, which is rendered on Github, directly, as HTML. If you are *already* familiar with Markdown, [GFL only adds a few useful tweaks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/ "Github-Flavored Markdown—official documentation"), otherwise you may want to read Github’s [Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) primer.
