# How does Drupal Console help?

## Generating the code and files required by a Drupal 8 module
Drupal Console provides a number of commands for creating module scaffolding and boilerplate code. For any command, you will be asked a series of questions about what you want to generate. Based on that user interaction, it will then generate the required boilerplate to build the requested component.

## Interacting with your Drupal installation.
Drupal Console allows you to interact with your Drupal installation, from rebuilding caches, to listing routes, services, and modules, and interacting with the configuration management.

## Learning Drupal 8
Drupal Console helps you learn Drupal 8. In addition to generating complex code, you can increase the verbosity of the code comments, to better understand the generated code and how to build on it, by using the `--learning` option.
