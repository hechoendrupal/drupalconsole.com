title: How to use Drupal Console in a multi-site installation
---

Drupal Console provides support for Drupal multi-site installations. This project provides the `debug:multisite` command to debug multi-site installations and the `--uri` option to interact with multi-site installations.

### How to list all known multi sites

Drupal Console uses the sites/sites.php file to determine the multi site configuration. See sites/example.site.php how to configure this file.

```bash
drupal debug:multisite

+---------------------+--------------------------------+
| Site                | Directory                      |
+---------------------+--------------------------------+
| drupal8.dev         | /var/www/drupal8.dev/default   |
| drupal8.multi.dev   | /var/www/drupal8.dev/multi.dev |
+---------------------+--------------------------------+

 Sites are written using the format: <port>.<domain>.<path>
```

### How to execute a command against a multi-site installation

```
drupal --uri=http://drupal8.multi.dev cr all
drupal --uri=drupal8.multi.dev cr all
```
