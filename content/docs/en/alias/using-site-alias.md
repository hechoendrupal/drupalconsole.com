title: Using site alias
---

Drupal Console allows you to run commands from your local server but actually execute them on a local, remote or virtual (VM, Docker) Drupal installation by using site aliases.

Site alias files uses YAML format to provide a collection of predefined options once an alias is defined you can call them using a short name. 

A site alias could be defined for a remote site by site using `type: ssh`. In this case the ssh command will be used to execute the command on the remote installation.   

Site alias files are discoverable from the following paths:

* **Globally**: `~/.console/sites/`
* **Per site**: `/path/to/site/console/sites/`
