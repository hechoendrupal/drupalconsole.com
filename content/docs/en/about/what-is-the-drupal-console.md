title: What is the Drupal Console?
---

The Drupal CLI. A tool to generate boilerplate code, interact with and debug Drupal. From the ground up, it has been built to utilize the same modern PHP practices which were introduced in Drupal 8.

Drupal Console started as an scaffolding tool but evolved into a full CLI with the help of multiple contributors.

The Drupal Console makes use of the Symfony Console and other third party components which allows you to automatically generate most of the code needed for a Drupal 8 module. In addition, Drupal Console helps you interact with your Drupal installation.
