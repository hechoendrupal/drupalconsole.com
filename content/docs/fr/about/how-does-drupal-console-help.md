# How does Drupal Console help?

## Generating the code and files required by a Drupal 8 module
Drupal Console provides a number of commands for creating module scaffolding and boilerplate code. For any command, you will be asked a series of questions about what you want to generate. Based on that user interaction, it will then generate the required boilerplate to build the requested component.

## Introspecting the system.
Drupal Console allows you to debug routes, services, plugins, configurations, events and other components and subsystems.

## Interacting with your Drupal installation.
Drupal Console help you to interact with your Drupal installation, from rebuilding cache, importing/exporting configuration, and resetting passwords among others.

## Learning Drupal 8
Drupal Console helps you learn Drupal 8. In addition to generating complex code, you can increase the verbosity of the code comments, to better understand the generated code and how to build on it, by using the `--learning` option.
