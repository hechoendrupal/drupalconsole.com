# What is the Drupal Console?
The Drupal Console is a suite of tools run from a command line interface (CLI) to generate boilerplate code and interact with a Drupal 8 installation. From the ground up, it has been built to utilize the same modern PHP practices which were introduced in Drupal 8.

The Drupal Console makes use of the Symfony Console and other third party components which allows you to automatically generate most of the code needed for a Drupal 8 module. In addition, Drupal Console helps you interact with your Drupal installation.
