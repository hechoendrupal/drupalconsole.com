Latest DrupalConsole rc-9 is out including several changes and fixes.

#### Support for command aliases

Aliases for commands added making easy to memorize by typing less. You can find aliases definition at 

#### Support to execute the DrupalConsole Launcher on Windows platform

This PR [https://github.com/hechoendrupal/drupal-console-launcher/pull/51]( https://github.com/hechoendrupal/drupal-console-launcher/pull/51) fixes the `\\vendor\\bin\\drupal.php` file not found error.

#### Execute DrupalConsole from any directory within your Drupal site

No need to stay at site root directory. You can now switch to any directory as modules, themes, web/modules/custom or any other directory within your Drupal site. This was possible using the DrupalFinder project 

**NOTE**: Having a configuration file containing `root: web` on the site is no longer required. You can keep the file but is required to remove that value from your `path/to/drupal8/console/config.yml`

#### Improvements on the `init` command 

The interactive mode for the init command now ask you and show a list of directories where to copy the configuration files.
